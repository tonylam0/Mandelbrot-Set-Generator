# Mandelbrot Set Generator
## About this project
This interactive Mandelbrot Set Generator visualizes different forms of the Mandelbrot set by allowing the user to change the **power** in its recursive formula. Built using **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Pygame**, the program renders high-resolution fractal images and supports non-integer and negative exponents.


## Features
- Customizable Mandelbrot power
- Real-time rendering with color-mapped iteration counts
- Supports both negative and non-integer powers
- Supports non-mandelbrot set formulas by adjusting the "z = z**Bounds.power + c" formula


## How It Works
The Mandelbrot set is generated by iterating the function:
$$z_{n+1} = z_n^p + c$$

Where:
- $z$ and $c$ are complex numbers
- $p$ is a user-defined exponent
- The number of iterations before $|z|$ escapes a defined radius determines pixel color
